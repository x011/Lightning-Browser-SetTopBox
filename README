My changes:
- Disables zoom using Java code and Javascript (the latter was needed because the double tap zoom cannot be easily disabled)
- Uses Lightning Touch from Rick Trott (https://github.com/trott/LightningTouch) in order to speed up touch events and make the browser faster
- Enabled hardware acceleration, seems to improve performance a teeeny little bit
- Modified the desktop user agent to use what the 4.0.3 android browser uses, this makes the desktop version of Facebook work.

These changes were made in order to have a more pleasant browsing experience on Android set-top boxes like the MK808 where the resolution is already high enough to make zoom pointless.
Also, if somebody double taps on the browser window it is not easy to undo the zoom with a keyboard and a mouse, as there is no other input interface than these.

Sadly, the performance s*cks on an actual MK808B but it works rather nicely on my old Asus Transformer TF101 which has an older processor.

ORIGINAL Readme:

This is an open source webkit based browser.

I make money of a similar paid version which currently has unlimited tabs and unlimited bookmarks. Modifiying two values at the top of the main activity "barbones" will turn this into the paid version.

Current issues:
- it doesn't open apps that belong to links like market:// youtube:// etc...
- can't set bookmarks as default view in fullscreen
